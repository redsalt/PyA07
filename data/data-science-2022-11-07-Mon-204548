Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter.

When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this site. Remote OK accepts no liability or responsibility as a consequence of any reliance upon information on there (external sites) or here.

When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this site. Remote OK accepts no liability or responsibility as a consequence of any reliance upon information on there (external sites) or here.

We’re now ready to build differentiated products on top of those foundations, utilizing data to drive the product decisions for both short term and long term bets.&nbsp;\n\nAs a data scientist on the ads data science team, you’ll be a key player in ensuring we make the right product decisions based on data insights and help define the culture that is driven through metrics and KPIs.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Reddit is hiring a </span><br>Remote Senior Data Scientist Ads Marketplace Analytics </h1>
<div class="markdown">\nWe are looking for a Senior level Data Scientist to work with our Ads product team. You will partner closely with cross functional team leaders such as GPMs, EMs and leadership in utilizing data to drive decision making.&nbsp; In addition to strong analytical skills, you will have a keen business acumen and the big picture thinking that can guide our Marketplace strategy in a data driven manner.\n\nReddit is continuing to grow our teams with the best talent. We're&nbsp;completely remote friendly&nbsp;and will continue to be after the pandemic.\n\nHow You’ll Have Impact:\n\nAdvertising is Reddit’s primary business model and we have an ambitious goal to turn it into a massive business. Although several large digital ad platforms already exist, advertisers are being increasingly drawn to Reddit because of our passionate communities that drive action. This large number of self-governed communities have highly-engaged users who are in an unduplicated mindset of consuming relevant information. This has created the opportunity for Reddit to build a massive and highly differentiated ads business.\n\nWe spent the past few years building the foundations of a modern ad serving system, building features to help brand and performance advertisers find their audiences on Reddit and get high ROI on their ad spend. We’re now ready to build differentiated products on top of those foundations, utilizing data to drive the product decisions for both short term and long term bets.&nbsp;\n\nAs a data scientist on the ads data science team, you’ll be a key player in ensuring we make the right product decisions based on data insights and help define the culture that is driven through metrics and KPIs. Reddit sits in a unique place, where there are still a lot of low hanging fruit that will immediately impact millions of users and thousands of advertisers.\n\nWhat You’ll Learn:\n\n\nYou will partner closely with our Ads Product and Engineering team, which is the core driver of revenue for the company.&nbsp; You’ll play a key role in developing Ads product strategy and experiments. You’ll play with petabytes of data full of user and advertiser interactions to develop a deeper understanding of Reddit’s ads ecosystem.&nbsp;\n\nIn addition, you will work side by side with a world-class org of Engineering, ML, Search, Data Science, Data Warehouse, and Analytics practitioners who work together to create a variety of capabilities for Reddit to be more successful in its decision-making and product creation. In this process, you will be exposed to a variety of new techniques in experimentation, statistical frameworks, machine learning, deep learning, and causal inference.\n\n\n\n\nWhat You’ll Do:\n\n\nAnalyze conversations and behaviors across Reddit's 10,000 interest-based communities, and convert them into insights and product recommendations.\n\nUnderstand Reddit advertising and help the company improve Ads Revenue while simultaneously improving ROAS (Return on Ads Spend) for advertisers and ads quality for users.\n\nConduct product/feature analyses, opportunity sizing, experimentation (A/B testing) and build dashboards/visualizations to assess product health.\n\nOrganize data by designing table schemas, data pipelines, aggregations, alerts and general data infrastructure for the Ads Organization.\n\nCollaborate with various cross-functional stakeholders, including Product Managers, Engineers, Designers, UX Researchers, Data Engineers and Data Warehouse Engineers to lead projects related to organizing and analyzing data.\n\nBe an integral part of the Data Org, leveraging and contributing to the vibrant knowledge base, shared across a community of world-class data experts.\n\n\n\n\nWho You Might Be:\n\n\n5+ years of experience in data analytics or related quantitative role\n\n2+ years of experience in the digital advertising space\n\nDemonstrated ability to influence and guide product strategy with data\n\nDemonstrated ability to take ambiguous problems and solve them in a structured, hypothesis-driven, data-supported way\n\nDesire to mentor other data scientists and share best practices to elevate the data science practice at Reddit\n\nStrong ability to communicate and discuss complex topics with technical &amp; non-technical audiences\n\nProficiency with relational database (e.g., SQL) and statistical analysis/programming languages (e.g., R / Python)\n\nProficiency with dashboarding tools (e.g. Mode Analytics, Tableau, Looker)\n\n\n \n\n#Salary and compensation\n
No salary data published by company so we estimated salary based on similar jobs related to Ads, Data Science, Senior and Stats jobs that are similar:\n\n
$70,000 — $122,500/year\n

When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name.

<strong>👉 Please reference you found the job on Remote OK, this helps us get more companies to post here, thanks!</strong><br><br>
When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this site. Remote OK accepts no liability or responsibility as a consequence of any reliance upon information on there (external sites) or here.

When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>.

Full-time roles only.\n\nHow are you funded?\n\nWe are backed by some of the top fintech investors in the world. Have raised single-digit millions of dollars so far. Can share more details over the call.\n\nDo you already have a product?\n\nCurrently in beta with 20+ customers.\n\nDo you plan to sell customer data?\n\nNtropy is on a mission to enable products without data barriers.

We will give you a take-home project related to whatever we are currently working on (3-4 hours). Alternatively, if you have a relevant project that you worked on previously that demonstrates your skills as an engineer, you are welcome to use that instead.\n\n3. We will then do a deep-dive through the project over a call and discuss the implementation, improvements and bottlenecks.\n\nAbove all, we respect your time and commitment and will keep you up to speed on where we are at during the whole process.\n\nWhat are your hiring plans?\n\nWe aim to be 22-25 people in the next 6 months. Mostly engineering roles.\n\nWhat is your current stack?\n\nback-end - Python + Rust (where performance matters)\ncompute - AWS + Azure\nML - PyTorch + ONNX\n\nWork / life balance?\n\nWe are a startup which requires you to put in a lot more work and soul than a regular job. It will require long hours and sacrificing your free time. We believe, however, that nothing easy is worth doing. We will expect a lot from you, and you should expect a lot from us.\n\nWhat is the compensation?\n\n$130k • 0.2% - 0.5%\n\n \n\n#Salary and compensation\n

<strong>👉 Please reference you found the job on Remote OK, this helps us get more companies to post here, thanks!</strong><br><br>
When applying for jobs, you should NEVER have to pay to apply. You should also NEVER have to pay to buy equipment which they then pay you back for later. Also never pay for trainings you have to do. Those are scams! NEVER PAY FOR ANYTHING! Posts that link to pages with "how to work online" are also scams. Don't use them or pay for them. Also always verify you're actually talking to the company in the job post and not an imposter. A good idea is to check the domain name for the site/email and see if it's the actual company's main domain name. Scams in remote work are rampant, be careful! <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1300443073562980353?s=20" style="font-weight:800;">Read more to avoid scams</a>. When clicking on the button to apply above, you will leave Remote OK and go to the job application page for that company outside this site. Remote OK accepts no liability or responsibility as a consequence of any reliance upon information on there (external sites) or here.
